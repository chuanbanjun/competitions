# you can put pre-train file in a dir. e.g. "PRE_TRAIN_DIR".
# Input file format:
  # (1) One sentence per line. These should ideally be actual sentences, not
  # entire paragraphs or arbitrary spans of text. (Because we use the
  # sentence boundaries for the "next sentence prediction" task).
  # (2) Blank lines between documents. Document boundaries are needed so
  # that the "next sentence prediction" task doesn't span between documents.
